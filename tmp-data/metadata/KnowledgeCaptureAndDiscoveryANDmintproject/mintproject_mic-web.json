This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.\n\nInstead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you\u2019re on your own.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn\u2019t be useful if you couldn\u2019t customize it when you are ready for it.\n",
