        "excerpt": "Contributing to the TA3-TA2 API\nChange proposals\nSuggested changes to the API can be made in one of two ways:\n\nBy logging issues against the repository.\nThrough merge requests.\n\nDiscussion of high level changes can be raised with the group and commented on using GitLab's issue tracking system.\nConcrete changes can be proposed by modifying code and submitting a merge request for review.\nMerge requests should be marked WIP in their title if they are being actively updated, with the tag being removed when the code is ready for final review.\nAll merge requests have to be against a devel branch.\nMerge requests should include also an entry to HISTORY.md with a summary of a change.\nCore vs. extensions\nThere are two classes of API defined in the system - core, defined in core.proto, and extensions, such as data_ext.proto, which are stored in separate files.  All TA2 systems must implement the core API, while extensions are considered optional.\nStyle\n\nAll changes to the .proto files should follow Google's Protobuf Style Guide.\nIndentation should be 4 spaces.\nProto file names should use snake_case, with extensions ending in _ext.  Example: dataflow_ext.proto",
