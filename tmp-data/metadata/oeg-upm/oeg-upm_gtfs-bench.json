            "excerpt": "We present GTFS-Madrid-Bench, **a benchmark to evaluate declarative KG construction engines** that can be used for the provision of access mechanisms to (virtual) knowledge graphs. Our proposal introduces several scenarios that aim at measuring performance and scalability as well as the query capabilities of all this kind of engines, considering their heterogeneity. The data sources used in our benchmark are derived from the [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs) data files of the subway network of Madrid. They can be transformed into several formats (CSV, JSON, SQL and XML) and scaled up. The query set aims at addressing a representative number of SPARQL 1.1 features while covering usual queries that data consumers may be interested in. \n",

It also includes CSVW annotations for the CSV distributions.\n- Folder [queries](https://github.com/oeg-upm/gtfs-bench/tree/master/queries) includes 18 queries with different levels of complexity including a representative set of SPARQL 1.1. operators. Additionally, the folder contains [11 simple queries](https://github.com/oeg-upm/gtfs-bench/tree/master/queries/simple) that will help to test the basic capabilities of virtual KG construction engines (i.e., to understand if the engine is able to translate correctly the SPARQL operators over different GTFS distributions before starting to test performance and scalability).\n \nOur experiences testing (virtual) knowledge graph engines have revealed the difficulties for setting up an infrastructure where many variables and resources are involved: databases, raw data, mappings, queries, data paths, mapping paths, databases connections, etc. For that reason, and in order to facilitate the use of the benchmark to any developer or practitioner, we provide a set of [utils](https://github.com/oeg-upm/gtfs-bench/tree/master/utils) such as docker-compose templates or evaluation bash scripts that, in our opinion, can reduce the time for preparing the testing set up.\n \n",
