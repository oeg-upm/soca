This ontology-based language settles on the assumption that all mapping languages, being used for the basic same purpose of describing data sources in terms of an ontology to create RDF, must have some basic patterns and inherent shared characteristics across all languages. The Conceptual Mapping's model is designed to represent and articulate these core features. \nThe scope of the vocabulary is to represent features based on declarative languages for describing data sources, their access, mapping rules for RDF transformation and functions. It is out of the scope representing the entire expressivenes of \"procedural\" languages based on SPARQL, such as SPARQL-Generate of Facade-X.\n \n",
